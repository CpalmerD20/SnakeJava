     * when comments are necessary. There are situations where I could
     * have used getters/setters, but I chose not to for readability.
     * 
     * The Food class is an example of where notation is needed. It's clear 
     * that certain rows of code are not readable, from a mathematics or 
     * English perspective. So comments are appropriate.
